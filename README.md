# Simulations
This repository consists of a couple of autonomous agents that can easily be created.

## Langton's ant
  This is a famous math game where an ant moves in a grid and each time it leaves a square it changes the colour of it.
  Then when it reaches the next square, it either turns right or left depending on the colour of the square, before moving forward again.'
  Then by fidling around with how the square should change colour and how the ants direction should depend on it one may create interesting paterns that one might not have guessed.
  
 ## Game of Life
  Conway's game of life is an even more famous math game where agin a grid is present.
  Here some of the squares are a live from the begining and some are dead.
  Then the board updates alla at once where a square might become dead or alive depending on the sorrounding 8 squares.
  By changing how the squares die and live and with the start setup on may creat many different structures. 
  Interesting objects include 'the glider', 'the shouter', 'the glider ship' and many more.
  
  ## Solar system
  This is a suuuper simple construction of the solar system with planets orbiting a star.
  And moons orbiting that planet and I think even one more layer.
  This was done to practise recursion.
